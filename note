- two pages index.html and whatlist.html
  index = search page. calls to OMBD API 
  with the title seached for and diplays search results.

- Button to add to watchlist which
  saves that data to local storage.

- Whatlist.html loads and displays 
  data from local storage.

This is my API KEY 1000 per day

OMDb API: http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=eedb40e

when i click on add the movie i can only save the id of that movie inside the movies array
when i show the movie on the search i have to check when the id of the movie match the old watch movies id
if it is show (added already) 
before adding new one the programme should check if we already have the movie on the list

when i open my watchlist then i can ask from the server to show me the data again based on the id of the movie
when i click delete => added deleted or done | and delelte it for real or maybe make it disspear slowly
